## Challenge Overview
The challenge to this assignment was trying to figure out the layer of the codes, I spent a lot of my time trying to figure out how to achieve the results with the last line of code to "print." To be honest, coding feels like a lot of detailed work and I think my eyes are sore from reading and my fingers are probably going to get carpal tunnel from hitting tab. Same logic from before and this time just more foundational knowledge for the next step.
